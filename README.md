# RNA-seq_Differential Gene Expression Analysis
RN-seq is utilized to screen a set of genes which are expressed at significantly different levels under different conditions. We will start with the raw read count, and learn:
* Count normalization* Sample-level quality analysis using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and hietarchical clustering methods * Gene differential expression analysis with EdgR
